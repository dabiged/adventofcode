## Comments:
### Day01 
1. was Rushing for leaderboard on part1 and was off-by-one. Submitted inside 2 mins though!
2. For part2 I started at arry location 2 and counted the next 2 measurements, not the last two. Again, rushing for leaderboard.

I ranked 3175/3057.

### Day02
Missed start of day by 1 minute.
1. Had issues with setup (didn't have things ready to go)
2. Lots of issues running previous day's code (unable to find day01_01 etc).
3. First mistake was not casting the input number to an int (was left as a str).
4. Second mistake was using the wrong input file reader (tried to import as array of ints).
