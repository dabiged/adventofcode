# Advent of Code 2019 in jupyter notebooks (Python)

## Comments:
I remember really struggling to get the IntCode computer working due to my lack of ability to write good tests and debug properly. I also recall that every second day seemed to rely on you having a functioning intcode computer.
I got stuck and ultimately lost interest.

IntCode computers are hard!
